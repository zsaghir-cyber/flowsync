FlowSync is a modern web application built to streamline focus and task management. It combines the scientifically proven Pomodoro technique with a seamless, real-time task tracking system. 

This project showcases my ability to handle complex state management, real-time database integration with Firebase, and modern deployment pipelines on Vercel.

## 💡 Engineering Challenges Overcome (Internship Focus)

During the build process, I tackled several production-level challenges:

1.  **Security Hardening:** Patched critical framework vulnerabilities (CVE-2025-66478) by managing deep-dependency updates to ensure a secure production environment.
2.  **CI/CD Debugging:** Resolved complex deployment blockers related to case-sensitivity and build-caching on Linux-based cloud servers.
3.  **Real-Time Syncing:** Managed React state synchronization between the countdown timer and external task databases.
